## Perks
### Killer Perks

The Killer Perks can be activated/dezactivated using **TRAINING** mode from the **GAME MODE** menu. Selecting **TRAINING** mode, will activate the selected perks at the maximum tier or at the maximum number of tokens(Hex: Huntress Lullaby). Each Killer Perk in **NORMAL** mode will have 50% changes to activate, when starting a generator, then the perks will have 10% changes to activate/dezativate the effect during the game. For **DECISIVE STRIKE** all killer perks will remain inactive.
  - Hex: Ruin - **Version 2.6.0** *(got nurfed in **Version 3.5.0**)* 
    - Good Skill Checks result in 3/4/5 % regression on the Generator.
    - Great Skill Checks grant 0 % bonus progression on the Generator.
  - Hex: Huntress Lullaby 
    - 1 to 4 Tokens: Time between the Skill Check warning sound and the Skill Check becomes shorter.
    - 5 Tokens: No Skill Check warning.
  - Unnerving Presence
    - Triggered Skill Checks' success zones are reduced by 40/50/60 %. 
### Survivor Perks
There is only **DECISIVE STRIKE** **(DS)** that can be selected from the **GAME MODE** menu.

## Toolboxes 
The Toolbox is an item that can be used to repair generators more quickly. Different Toolboxes have different uses and not all of them are good for both uses. Add-ons can be equipped to enhance their speed and durability. Toolboxes and add-ons can be bought with bloodpoints. You can gain bloodpoins fast by hitting great skillchecks multiple times. You can gain free Bloodpoints by finding the secret :)
